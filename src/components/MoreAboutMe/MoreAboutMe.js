      <p>After several years as a Professional Brewer and several medals in local and international competitions, I found a new joy in programming <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHeart} />.
        <br />
        I love to design minimalistic and clean projects, but also can make fun and neat design. I cook what You tell me!
        <br />
        I have been studying for almost half a year this new Front End Engineering career, where I have learned about
        accessibility, testing, UI & UX, React, good practices and more.
        <br />
        I can communicate in English and Espa√±ol.</p>
